# World Wise

Practice project ot learn how to use React Router, Context API, and using Context API + reducers together.

This project essentially shows a website selling an app to track where you traveled, pin those places, and/or delete them from your list of places

Also learned some how to use a Map API, among others.

This uses `json-server` to provide a fake data to load your list of places, which can be run through the `server` script.
